# Asynctask-using-ProgressDialog
It's a very simple Android application, just for experimenting that how AsyncTask and ProgressDialog works. 
In this application we will simply sleep the particular activity for a specified time in seconds(Input will be given by user). 
Meanwhile It will display the ProgressDialog, And after the completion of time duration, It will change the text, and so for how many times the activity has slept.

Good Luck
